# Task Management App

A simple task management application built with React, using local storage for persisting tasks between sessions. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and toggle tasks as complete. Tasks are organized into separate sections for incomplete and completed tasks, and are color-coded based on priority.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add a new task with a title, description, and priority (low, medium, high).
- **Edit Tasks**: Existing tasks can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Mark tasks as complete or incomplete by clicking on the checkbox.
- **Search Functionality**: Search tasks by title or description.
- **Priority Color Coding**: Tasks are color-coded based on priority:
  - Red: High
  - Yellow: Medium
  - Green: Low
- **Completed Section**: Completed tasks move to a separate section and can be unchecked to move them back to the incomplete section.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks persist between sessions using local storage.
